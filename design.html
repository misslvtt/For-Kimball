    <h3>Dear Kimball, </h3>
        <p style="text-align: left"> 
                <br> <br>
            This website was designed and written with love. I thought it would be fun to make something that will help 
            us remember all of the amazing times we have shared toegther. Marrying you was one of the best decisions 
            that I have ever made and has brought me so much joy. Thank you for being an amazing husband and father. I 
            hope we can continue to add to this as time goes on, (since no website is ever really finsihed, right?) and
            make more memories and have more fun adventures. 
            
            <br> <br>
            I love you so much Kimball! 
            <br> <br>
            with love,
            <br> <br>
            your beautiful and talented programmer wife, Missy
        </p>
</div>


<div id="Friends-Dating" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>It all started at FHE.</h3>
  <p>I remember seeing Kimball for the first time. 
For some reason I thought his name was Griffin and I remembered we played Secret Hitler.
He came late and left early. I knew he was James' new roommate so we didn't really get to know eachother until James apologized 
to me in March. That's when I took this picture. Kimball got really close to a lot of people in that ward..."</p>


<img class=img-center src="first pic I took of you.JPG" alt="first pic I took" >


<p>After pining after him for a few months (with a couple breaks in between), I could no longer contain my feelings. 
I had to tell him what I was thinking or I was going to go insane. We had stayed up late talking at the ward campout and 
spent hours talking in fun "op" and "ong" languages. We had "danced" the night away at classic skating. </p>


<img class=img-center src="rollerblading night.jpg" alt=rollerblading>

<p>He stood out to me, he was funny, attractive, and radiated goodness. I had to do something! I texted him at 3am and told him I wanted to talk to 
him about something. I paced back and forth as I waited for him to come over the following morning. He came to the door and I panicked. 
What do I say? I decided to keep putting it off.. "Can we go outside?" "Uhh, sure.." "Can we go sit in my car?" "Yeah..." "Do you want to go to
the park?" "Alright?" So we did.. and I continued to talk about random things until I finally got the courage to explain why I wanted to talk. 
I told him that I thought that he was "pretty cool" and that I wanted to get to know eachother better. Luckily, he agreed and by the end of 
the next week, we had seen eachother every night. We stayed up for hours just talking. It was so much fun. The first time we held hands it just 
felt right, and I was so happy. </p>
<br/>


<p>So then dates starting happening..</p>


<img class=img-center src='1st Pic dating.jpg'alt=firstpictogether style=width:50%>
<p>The 4th of July in Gunlock, less than a week after we starting dating. </p>

<img class=img-center src="dating neice and nephews.jpg" alt=swimming style=width:50%>
<p>Meeting both families.</p>


<img class=img-center src="dating murder mystery dinner.jpg" alt=murdermystery style=width:50%>
<p>Murder Mystery Dinner with friends. </p>


<img class=img-center src="byu game dating.JPG" alt=byugame style=width:50%>
<p>Because we opened up an account with DFCU, we ended up winning box tickets to the BYU game and we invited my parents. It was out first date 
    with them and I was very nervous. 
</p>

<img class=img-center src="ice skating goofy.JPG" alt=goofyice style=width:50%>
<p>We discovered that we both love iceskating.</p>

<img class=img-center src="my couch dating.JPG" alt=mycouchdating style=width:50%>
<p>We stayed up way too late and always fell asleep on the couch.. I never liked waking him
    up to send him home. 
</p>

<img class=img-center src="too many sandwiches dating.jpg" alt=toomanysandwiches style=width:50%>
<p>We would meet on campus and eat lunch together, sometimes ending up with way too many sandwiches.
</p>

<img class=img-center src="so much love dating.jpg" alt=somuchlove style=width:50%>
<p>We even starting using the "L" word.</p>

<img class=img-center src="ice skating normal.JPG" alt=normalice style=width:50%>
<p>But then.... we broke up. Worst 4 days EVER.;) It was a huge step in our relationship, we were able to work through our issues and then we 
    became a whole lot closer. That's when things got serious... 
</p>
<img class=img-center src='fake engagement.JPG'alt=fakeengagementpic style=width:50%>

<p>WARNING:This is a fake picture. He actually proposed inside the temple.</p>

    <div class="row">  
        <div class="column">
          <img src="piggyback engagement.jpg" alt="piggybackMis" style="width:100%">

        <div class="column">

        </div>
        <div class="column"></div>

 
    </div>

    <p>Fun fact: We actually took these engagement pictures before we got engaged. Other fun fact: while we were here, a lady came up 
    to us and told us her son was in jail for taking pictures on the tracks.. We left shortly after.
    </p>

    <img class=img-center src="Last Thanksgiving apart.jpg" alt=thanksgivingsnap style=width:50%>
    <p>Our last holiday apart. 
    </p>

    <div class="row">  
            <div class="column">
              <img src="almost married kim.jpg" alt="almostmarriedkim" style="width:100%">

    </div>

    <p>And then we got ready for the big day...</p>
</div>

<div id="Wedding" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>It was perfect day.</h3> 
<img class=img-center src="wedding annoucement.JPG" alt=weddingannouncement style=width:50%>
<br> <br>

<img class=img-center src="walking out wedding.JPG" alt=walkingout style=width:50%>
<p>We were so nervous to come out after the sealing. So much excitement and so many emotions.</p>


<img class=img-center src="walking out wedding2.JPG" alt=walkingout2 style=width:50%>
<p>Mostly just happy emotions</p>

<img class=img-center src="wedding kiss.JPG" alt=weddingkiss style=width:50%>
<p>And lots of kissing...</p>

<img class=img-center src="wedding kiss (2).JPG" alt=weddingkiss2 style=width:50%>
<p>and kissing...</p>

<img class=img-center src="wedding kiss3.jpg" alt=weddingkiss3 style=width:50%>
<p>and kissing...</p>

<img class=img-center src="wedding kiss 4.jpg" alt=weddingkiss4 style=width:50%>
<p>and kissing...</p>

<img class=img-center src="wedding kiss 5.jpg" alt=weddingkiss5 style=width:50%>
<p>and kissing...</p>

<img class=img-center src="wedding kiss 6.jpg" alt=weddingkiss6 style=width:50%>
<p>and kissing...</p>

<img class=img-center src="wedding kiss 7.jpg" alt=weddingkiss2 style=width:50%>
<p>and kissing...</p>

<img class=img-center src="wedding kiss gross.JPG" alt=weddingkissgross style=width:50%>
<p>Okay okay, you get the picture.</p>

<img class=img-center src="wedding pic.JPG" alt=weddingpic style=width:50%>
<p>We looked daaaaang good.</p>


<img class=img-center src="wedding family kim.JPG" alt=weddingfamilykim style=width:50%>
<img class=img-center src="wedding family miss.JPG" alt=weddingfamilymis style=width:50%>
<p>It was amazing to have the support of our families.</p>

<img class=img-center src="wedding kids.JPG" alt=weddingkids style=width:50%>
<p>And the adorable kids..</p>

<img class=img-center src="wedding line.JPG"alt=weddingline style=width:50%>
<p>And even the support of people we didn't really know. Even (or especially) when it was in the form of money.</p>

<img class=img-center src="wedding cake.JPG" alt=weddingcake style=width:50%>
<p>I asked Kimball to feed me the cake gently, and he did. 
He was respectful of all of my wishes for the reception, most 
of which were to avoid drawing too much attention to myself. 
I didn't want dancing, and even though Kimball loves to dance, 
he said he was totally fine with it. Even though it was a small thing,
it meant a lot. </p>

<img class=img-center src="wedding donuts.JPG" alt=weddingdonuts style=width:50%>
<img class=img-center src="wedding hot chocolate.JPG" alt=weddinghotchocolate style=width:50%>
<p>Since my parents told us we could keep the money we didn't spend, we decided to go cheaper 
    on the food. We didn't even eat any at the reception anyway. 
    But we did end up having extra donuts and bringing them with us 
    on our honeymoon... 
</p>
</div>


<div id="Honeymoon" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Kissimmee, Florida</h3>

  <img class=img-center src="honeymoon start fam.JPG" alt=honeymoonstartfam  style=width:50%>
  <p>Interestingly enough, this is the first picture we took on our honeymoon. 
      Since Christmas was right smack in the middle, we chose to go back to Mountain Green
      and then to Gunlock so we could see our families on Christmas.
  </p> 

  <img class=img-center src="honeymoon selfie 1.JPG" alt=honeymoonselfie style=width:50%>
<p>One thing that we found problematic was that since we were on our honeymoon, we had no one
    to take pictures of us..</p>
    <img class=img-center src="honeymoon selfie 2.JPG" alt=selfie2 style=width:50%>
    <img class=img-center src="honeymoon selfie 3.JPG" alt=selfie3 style=width:50%>
    <img class=img-center src="honeymoon selfie 4.JPG" alt=selfie4 style=width:50%>
    <img class=img-center src="honeymoon selfie 5.JPG" alt=selfie5 style=width:50%>
<p>Luckily, I know how to take a good selfie. :)</p>
    
<img class=img-center src="honeymoon hotel.JPG" alt=honeymoonhotel style=width:50%>
<p>My parents were kind enough to let us stay in their timeshare, which turned out to be amazing! We didn't get out much though,
    we prefered staying inside, eating chinese take-out, watching Harry Potter and napping. ;) 
</p>

<img class=img-center src="honeymoon mall art.JPG" alt=honeymoonmall style=width:50%>
<p>One night we went out to dinner at a mall and they had some pretty creative art there. </p>

<img class=img-center src="honeymoon sea world.JPG" alt=seaworld style=width:50%>
<p>We even made it to Sea World! Where we ended up riding like 2 rides, getting sick, and falling asleep on some benches for like an hour... 
    They did have some pretty cool shows though, and we stayed awake for most of them. 
</p>

<img class=img-center src="honeymoon temple.JPG" alt=honeymoon temple style=width:50%>
<p>We even got to go the temple. It was a really special thing to do right after we were sealed. Afterward we ate Olive Garden
    where we met our favorite server ever. He sent us home with a bunch of salad and breadsticks. I guess we are suckers for free food. 
</p>
<img class=img-center src="honeymood armadillo.JPG" alt=armadillo style=width:50%>
<p>We went on a  boardwalk with a couple that we had met at church and saw an armadillo. The couple was so sweet, but we kind of felt kidnapped. They made us 
    dinner and showed us around Kissimmee. They kept us for about 5 hours, but we were so grateful for their generosity. We will never forget 
    our honeymoon grandparents. 
</p>

<img class=img-center src="honeymoon fake dude.JPG" alt=fakedude style=width:50%>
<p>On our way home we saw this guy... I swear he was real! 
    We really enjoyed our time together. It was a perfect honeymoon and we were ready and excited to go home and start our new 
    life together, full of adventures and mishaps...
</p>

</div>

<div id="Adventures" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>So many good times.</h3>

    <img class=img-center src="adventure no bed.JPG" alt=nobed style=width:50%>
<p>We started out our marriage bedless. We still hadn't figured out how we were going to get my bed from Moutain Green to Provo.
 </p>

<img class=img-center src="first apartment.JPG" alt=firstapt style=width:50%>
<p> We loved our first apartment, Liberty Center. They had free soda, a small gym, a parking garage, free food, and great management. 
        It was a great way to start off our marriage.</p>

<img class=img-center src="adventure first home bed.JPG" alt=bed style=width:50%>
<p>And eventually we got a bed and then look what happened...</p>


<div class="row">  
        <div class="column">
                <img class=img-center src="pregnant adventure.JPG" alt=pregadventure style=width:100%>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img src="pregant adventure 2.JPG" alt="pregadventure2" style="width:100%">
        </div>
        <div class="column"></div>

 
</div>

<p>Sometimes being pregnant was a hard and uncomfortable adventure, but I would say the majority of the time, I really enjoyed it. 
It was really exciting and luckily I only threw up one time. We went out to eat way too much because I didn't want to make anything
and I always wanted pizza. </p>

<img class=img-center src="pregant adventure pic 1.JPG" alt=preg1 style=width:50%>
<p>It felt like forever before I started to show. Once I did though, we started comparing bellies.. I think he actually beat me in 
    some of these...</p>

    <img class=img-center src="pregnant adventure pic 2.JPG" alt=preg2 style=width:50%>
    <img class=img-center src="pregnant adventure pic 3.JPG" alt=preg3 style=width:50%>
    <img class=img-center src="pregnant adventure pic 4.JPG" alt=preg4 style=width:50%> 
    <img class=img-center src="pregnant adventure pic 5.jpg" alt=preg5 style=width:50%>

</br>
</br>

<img class=img-center src="tennis adventures.jpg" alt=tennisadventure style=width:50%>
<p>Once I got pregnant, we started playing tennis. Kimball pretty much beat me every time, but it was still really fun. 
        I hated bending down when I was pregnant though so I usually would kick Kimball all the balls so he could pick them up. </p>

<img class=img-center src="homeless adventure.jpg" alt=homeless style=width:50%>
<p>One time while I was walking back from campus, I said hi to a homeless man... the snapchat I sent to Kimball tells the rest of 
    the story.  </p>



<img class=img-center src="graduation adventure.jpg" alt=graduationadventure style=width:50%>
<p>Then I graduated! We acutally announced that I was pregnant on the day of graduation because we had a lot of family together. 
    It was at Chili's and I was wearing a shirt that had a baby on it. 
</p>

<img class=img-center src="gender reveal adventure.JPG" alt=genderreveal style=width:50%>
    <p>To announce whether we were having a boy or a girl, I made cupcakes that had fake plastic saftey pins and one of them was either 
        green for a boy or purple for a girl. Jen found a green saftey pin in her cupcake! We were having baby boy! 
    </p>

 
    <div class="row">  
            <div class="column">
                    <img class=img-center src="nauvoo adventure.JPG" alt=nauvoo1 style=width:100%>

            <div class="column"></div>
    
     
    </div>
    <p>In some ways I think Nauvoo falls under the mishaps, but it definitely had its highlights. We saw the Nauvoo pageant and several
        other shows that I enjoyed. I loved to see Kimball in a place that is so special for him.
    </br>
    The hard part was sitting for hours while I was 7 months pregnant and dealing with the humidity there as well. I don't think I will
    go to Nauvoo while I am pregnant, ever again...
    </p>

    <h3>*Fast forward several months* (Wesley gets his own category so we are going to skip over that adventure for now.)</h3>
    

    <img class=img-center src="ocean adventure.JPG" alt=ocean adventure style=width:50%>
    <p>This was one of the biggest adventure of them all. We went to Scandinavia with a 6 month old. We decided a few things after this trip.. <br>
        1. We like free toilet paper. <br>
        2. A bunless hotdog with fried onions is delicious. <br>
        3. We never want to ride a train again. <br>
        4. On vacations, we will stay in the same hotel for at least a week. 
        5. Wesley is an angel. 
        6. We love Germany their ice cream. 
    </p>

    <img class=img-center src="rodeo adventure.jpg" alt=rodeoadventure style=width:50%>
    <p>Momma Leavitt was kind enough to watch Wesley for us while we went to the Gunlock Rodeo. The last time we had gone before this 
        was when we were dating. Kimabll tried to convince me to ride a donkey to go get a watermelon. I almost did. This time Kimball 
        didn't even attempt to convince me, because he knew me much better at this point. :) 
    </p>

    <img class=img-center src="longslide adventure.jpg" alt=longslide style=width:50%>
    <p>We went to Kimball's family reunion in Idaho and they had a giant slide there, we both went down. The night before we came to this cabin
        we were at a girls' camp and slept in the motor home with Wesley. He got sick and threw up and was up until like 11pm watching Psych with 
        us because he was too sad to sleep. 
    </p>

    <img class=img-center src="hiking timp adventure.jpg" alt=hikingtimp style=width:50%>
    <p>We hiked to the Timp cave with my family. With all the kids and 3 babies it was quite the adventure, but it was enjoyable. Our tour guide talked 
        too much though. Bless his heart. 
    </p>

    <img class=img-center src="Haloween adventure.jpg" alt=halloween style=width:50%>
    <p>We decided (or I guess I decided) that since we have a baby now that we needed to dress up for Halloween. If you can't tell, I am 
        a safari person, Kimball is wearing a Lion shirt, and Wesley is a lion. He definitely looked the best. (besides Kimball)
    </p>


  </div>
  
  <div id="Mishaps" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>oops..</h3> 


    <img class=img-center src="keys mishap.jpg" alt= style=width:50%>
    <p>Very soon after we got married, I went to take a test and I accidently left the keys in the car. I think you were taking 
        a test so I wasn't able to get your help. I had to pay someone to come open my car because I had to have a parking pass in my car
        while I took the test, but I couldn't put it in. Awkward..
    </p>


    <img class=img-center src="Pregnant ER Mishap.JPG" alt=PregnantER style=width:50%>
    <p>While I was pregnant I started having symptoms of a UTI.. painful urination and having to go ALL the time, which I already did. 
        I hadn't told anyone I was pregnant yet and I was convinced it was going to harm my baby. I stayed up in the middle of the looking up 
        things about kidney infections. Me up in the middle of the night is just a bad idea. I convinced myself I had a kidney infection 
        and woke Kimball up to take me to the ER. (Little did I know how expensive the ER is, I guess I had to learn the hard way) While 
        I found out that I had a UTI, which easily could have been treated the next day at an instacare. My late night worrying cost me 
        over $1000.. never again. 
    </p>

    <div class="row">  
        <div class="column">
                <img class=img-center src="Wesley ER mishap.jpg" alt=WesER style=width:100%>

    </div>
    <p>Except it did happen again. This time it was for little Wesley. I threw up for the first time, 3 times we we were worried. We 
        called the Metabolic clinic twice and they told us to take him. He didn't throw up at all at the hospital. Because he has MCAD, 
        they had to run a bunch of horrible test on him, including getting a urine sample with a catheter, which for a little 6 month old
        is miserable. &#x1F494; We stayed over night at the hospital and got a free meal. Luckily Wesley was on medicaid still so we didn't have to 
        pay a dime. We had a horrible nurse who talked way too much. Bless her heart. 
    </p>

    <img class=img-center src="Finger mishap.jpg" alt=finegermishap style=width:50%>
    <p>And then it happened again.. but this time we went in for good reason. Avocados. Totally worth it... NOT. I was making avocado toast
        (which is delicious by the way) and I was trying to get the pit out with a cutco knife. I still am a little unclear about how the cut
        ended up on top of my hand. I told Kimball that I had just cut myself really bad and he didn't believe me! Then I showed him and got 
        faint and bossed him around "Call my dad! Wrap my finger! Not like that!" Then we went to the ER (AGAIN) and a nice doctor stitched 
        it up. I have a cool scar now and it's still numb on the top of my finger, must have hit a nerve. It cost quite a bit, but I guess 
        its worth keeping a finger. 
    </p>

    <img class=img-center src="no AC mishap.jpg" alt=noAC style=width:50%>
    <p>One very unfortunate part of our time at the Orem house was the lack of AC. After living there for several months it started to get 
        hot... really hot. We tried to turn on the AC.. but then found out that it didn't exist! They bought swamp cooler that really only
        cooled the small space around it. So we moved our matress to the much cooler basement along with Wesley's pack n' play for months 
        until we moved out. They got AC a few weeks later, ha! 
    </p>

    <img class=img-center src="stroller mishap.jpg" alt=strollermishap style=width:50%>
    <p>When we went to Scandinavia, we decided to take our stroller so we wouldn't have to carry Wesley around the whole time. Smart right?
        Apparently not, they broke our stroller and told us to talk to the airline later to report it. We went the whole trip without a 
        stroller and then when we got back it was too late to report it. We were not reimbursed. Still bitter. 
     </p>

    <img class=img-center src="chaitr mishap.jpg" alt=chairmishap style=width:50%>
    <p>When Wesley started to pull himself up he also started to pull things down... including a chair, on top of his face.
         Poor cute sweet Wesley. </p>

    <img class=img-center src="broken toe mishap.jpg" alt=brokentoe style=width:50%>
    <p>My toes endure a lot. Wesley and Kimball like to drop things on them and I like to hit them on stuff. This time I hit my little toe on a 
        table and probably broke it. Kimball worked from home for a few days while I dealt with the pain.
    </p>

    <img class=img-center src="fainting mishap.jpg" alt=faintingmishap style=width:50%>
    <p>After Wesley and I had endured so many of our own mishaps, Kimball finally had one of his own. The night before the incident, 
        he had eat 2 huge bags of sugary chewy candy at my parents house. He woke up to go to the bathroom and well then he was on the floor. I heard a loud noise and 
        Wesley had woken up crying. Kimball layed limp on the floor of the bathroom. My heart dropped and I tried to squeeze my way in to talk to 
        him. He was very dizzy and super out of it. I woke up my dad and he offered to get some medicine to help the dizziness. Kimball took it 
        and it took him about a half hour to make his way back in our bed. Still not super sure why he fainted, but he sure left his mark in my parents 
        wall.

    <h3>And then our lives changed forever...</h3>

  
    <img class= img-center src="Pregnant adventure almost here.jpg" alt=wesiscomin style=width:50%>
    <p>When Wesley starting making his way into the world through labor, all I wanted was Panda Express. I didn't quite know if I 
        was in labor or not, but I knew they wouldn't let me eat later if I was. I ate the whole box, which I never do. After Kimball
    got home, my back started hurting. It was back pain in waves and I thought, "This can't be labor!" It was. We went to the hospital 
when my "back labor" progressed and sped up. They admitted us and we waited for me to recieve an epidural. The doctor kept getting mad 
at me because I couldnt keep my back straight. I AM IN LABOR GOSH DANG IT. YOU KEEP YOUR BACK STRAIGHT. (I wanted to say) Finally he got 
it in but I could still feel pain, so I asked for a higher dose. Eventually they gave in and then I couldn't feel a thing. Wesley
was ready to come! When I was dialted to a 10 about 4 hours later I started to push. I pushed for 2 hours and he was out. Kimball said 
he looked like a little alien. Wes was 7lbs 5oz. 
</p>
          

    <img class=img-center src="Wesley Hello World.jpg" alt=weshi style=width:50%>
    <p>He was so perfect and precious. A few days later, I got a phone call. (well, several phone calls because I missed them.) A woman
        told me in panic that Wesley had MCAD deficiency and that if he didn't eat for 2 hours, he could die. I was in shock. It was 
        so hard to think that my perfect little baby wasn't so perfect. As we came to understand the deficiency, we learned that 
        it was totally managable. The time that he can go without eating increases and he gets bigger and will eventually be 12-14 hours
        at most. Wesley Judd Leavitt is our perfect little MCAD baby, named after our common MCADD ansestor William Riley Judd. 
        Fun fact that Kimball doesn't like me sharing but that I love to share, Wesley and Kimball are fourth cousins! 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Unfortunately, we realized very quickly that our sleep would never be the same again...</p>

    <p>Lucky for Kimball, he can sleep through anything, so Wes and him had lots of quality nap time.</p>

<p>He looks darn cute in them too. &#x1F60D; </p>

<img class=img-center src="wesley in stroller with hat.jpg" alt=wesleyhatstroller style=width:50%>

<p>You know, I am not sure if we bring out the weird in Wesley, or he brings out the weird in us. I think in this case, Wesley came first.</p>

<img class=img-center src="Wes spaghetti.jpg" alt=wesspag style=width:50%>

<img class=img-center src="wes and leaves.jpg" alt=wesleaves style=width:50%>



<p>Even though Wesley doesn't techincally carry the "Leavitt" blood, It seems like he actually have somehow inherited it.</p>

<img class=img-center src="wes and horse.jpg" alt=weshorse style=width:50%>

<img class=img-center src="wes and bull.jpg" alt=wesbull style=width:50%>

<p>Wesley loves people. He is constantly looking for attention and stares at strangers, hoping they will look at him. 
    He often reaches out to strangers to hold him and smiles at anyone and everyone. He makes everyone feel like they
    are special. (Or maybe he makes everyone realize they are.) He's our little ray of sunshine. And he's got two hooligans to 
    play with. 
</p>

  <div id="Food" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>Yes, food deserves its own category.</h3>
    <img class=img-center src="shepards pie food.JPG" alt=shepardspie style= width:50%>
<p>When we first got married, we used out instant pot a ton. We often made Shepard's pie, it was delicious. We started gain a lot of 
    weight because when we made a meal, we would eat like 3 servings.. 
</p>

    <img class=img-center src="meal food.jpg" alt=mealfood style=width:50%>
<p>While this meal looks like it was pretty good, we tried this recipe with flour tortillas and it was nasty.</p>

<img class=img-center src="conference waffles food.jpg" alt=conferencewaffles style=width:50%>
<p>Since we have been married, food has been a bit part of our celebrations. Waffles, ice cream, and peach syrup is a 
    tradition that Kimball's family does on conference morning. 
</p>

<img class=img-center src="smash burger food.jpg" alt=smashfood style=width:50%>
<p>We had a few of these coupons to Smash Burger and now we are hooked. We have decided to make it a tradition to go there whenever 
    Kimball finishes a semester. It is probably the best cheeseburger I have ever had. 
</p>

</br>
<p>We decided to do a "healthy habits" program. We did it twice, for a total of 16 weeks of eating fairly healthy. So we found some 
    healthier foods that we really liked..
</p>

<img class=img-center src="spaghetti squash food.jpg" alt=spaghettisquash style=width:50%>
<p>This is spaghetti squash alfredo "pasta." It was so good. </p>
<img class=img-center src="zuchini enchiladas.jpg" alt=zucchinienchiladas style=width:50%>
<p>These are zucchini enchiladas. They were also amazing.</p>
<img class=img-center src="healthy banana muffin.jpg" alt=bananamuffin style=width:50%>
<p>I found a few times of muffins that I really enjoyed making. They had no refined sugar.. but they had a whole lot of 
    pure maple syrup, which probably isn't much better. (But we were allowed to eat it during our healthy habits time)
</p>
<img class=img-center src="pumkin zuchini bread food.jpg" alt=pumpkin style=width:50%>
<p>This is chocolate chip pumpkin zuchini bread. It was amazing! (also made with maple syrup)</p>
<img class=img-center src="overnight oats food.jpg" alt=overnightoats style=width:50%>
<p>When we found overnight oats we were really excited. We starting making them every night so we would have our breakfast made in 
    the morning.. we thought we were being so healthy.. then I did a calorie count.. it was like 700 calories. Woah. So we don't make 
    them as much anymore. 
</p>

<img class=img-center src="food eggs.jpg" alt=eggs style=width:50%>
<p>Eggs are our staple food. Whenever we can't think of what to eat, or don't have "anything" to eat, we resort to eggs. Kimball makes 
    the best eggs. 
</p>

<img class=img-center src="reeses food.jpg" alt=reeses style=width:50%>
<p>Kimball likes to find reese's that don't leave a trail of chocolate when you take it out of the wrapper. He took this picture to
    vent about his strong feelings. 
</p>

<div class="row">  

        <div class="column">

        </div>
        
    </div>
<p>I have been watching a lot of the Great British Baking show and it has really made me want to bake!! Both of these creations took me a few hours. 
    I made the eyeball cookies for a ward baking compeition. I won the award for the best themed dessert. ($10 to Chick-fil-A!! Woo!)
    I obviously made the cake for Wesley's first birthday. It was really fun to make! 
</p>

 <img class=img-center src="breakfast in Norway food.jpg" alt=norwayfood style="width:50%">
<p>Some of the best food that we have had toegether was the food we had in Norway. This was a typical breakfast there. It was 
    Kimball's favorite. 
</p>

<img class=img-center src="orange chicken food.jpg" alt=orangechicken style="width:50%">
<p>I made this for Kimball on his birthday. Its orange chicken and rice. We both agreed we liked it more than Panda Express, which 
    is really saying something. (For Kimball at least.)
</p>

<img class=img-center src="Kimball's creations food.jpg" alt=Kimballcreation style="width:50%">
<p>One thing that Kimball likes to do is put together leftovers to make something new. Honestly, most of the time his creations are nasty.
    I should have documented more of them, but he is one that really made me gag...
</p>
      <p>If you can't tell, food is a big part of our lives.. (that's not a fat joke).</p>
